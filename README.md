# Frametastic
Easily test your design in different viewports by saving your favorite frame sizes combinations. Use any combination for new frames or for duplicating your current selection. 

1. Make your design
2. Add the needed constrains
3. Frametastic will do the rest

We've also prepared a couple videos for you to better know how to work with Frametastic:
